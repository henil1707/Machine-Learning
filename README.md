### Type of filtering used in Movie recommendation system
    

##  Demographic Filtering 
    
    This provides the same recommendation to all the audience based on popularity, rating or genre of the item. We can see this type of recommendations in sections such as 'Trending Now', 'Popular on Netflix', etc. 
    This is one of the most simple form of filtering.
    For Example: If we have 3 Users, User 1 age is 30 like product a,User 2 age is 20 like product b,then if third user's age is 30 then he gave simillar product like user a.
## Contentbased Filtering
    This suggests similar items based on a particular item. This uses the item's similarity with the previously liked or saved items of the user based on item's metadata or current search keywords used by user to find some item.
    This assumes that a user has higher chances to like similar items based on previous history of the user.
    For Example: If user watch movie then content based filtering give a result similar content movie to user.
